SrbAI-Pro - A Python library for Serbian language processing
========================================================

SrbAI-Pro is a project that gathers algorithms and models for processing the Serbian language into a unified Python library. The library should contain both basic methods for processing Serbian, such as stemmer, part-of-speech tagging, negation, to more advanced features, such as named entity tagging, classification, etc. The library can easily be extended with new methods, so the idea is to involve a larger number of students, PhD students, and other people who work and are interested in the development of Serbian language processing in the development of the project.

The vision of the project is to become a **unique and comprehensive resource for processing the Serbian language** that would be used for academic or commercial purposes.
